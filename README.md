JavaScript First Iteration with Frost
______________________________________
Objective: Make a website that has two pages:
- Home
- Data

Home: will need to look like (Image bellow) You can use your own text, colors, icons but structure needs to stay as in template

____________________________________
Data: You will need to replicate https://open-meteo.com/en/docs at basic level

Frost would like to see: 

1) ajax request from external api
2) data processing as in drawn into a table
3) data queryable with forms and table refreshed with new results

Note: To not overcomplicate the task you can hardcode few countries Latitude and Longtitude 

All this needs to be done using plain JS and CSS.

The point of this task is to grasp basics on how packages we will be using works under the hood.
